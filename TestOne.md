You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png) 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Test Unordered List:

- Item One Test
- Item Two Test

Ordered List: 

1. test order one
2. test order two

This is another test.
