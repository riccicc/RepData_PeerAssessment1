Testing the steps for the complete process. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/ric/RepData_PA1")
getwd()
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
